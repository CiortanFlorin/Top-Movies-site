# Top-Movies-site

Unfortunately, I cannot host this site, as I am limited to just 1 account on Heroku, but I still decided to post the code on Github.

The run the site you will need to write a security key variable and an API key for the movie API.

Technologies used: Flask, FlaskForms, SQLalchemy, API, HTML, CSS

Features:

-the user can search for whatever movie it wants, just introduce some words and the API will return all the movies which contain that word

-after selecting the movie, the user is asked for a review and a rating

-after the user enters his movies, the site shows them in the order of the rating with their respective posters
